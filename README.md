# RaspberryPiProjects

This repository contains the codes for the Raspberry Pi projects in python. 
So far we have the Pi to succesfully read the data from a gyroscope L3GD20. The code file is named ReadL3GD20.py.

We are still testing the project for reading the GPS data. The code will be uploaded when we finish.
